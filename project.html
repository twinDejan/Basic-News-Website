                <p class="lead">The <strong>Los Angeles Lakers'</strong> star once again headlines the list
                    of starters for his side of the 68th All-Star Game.
                    He joins Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo, the top vote-getter from the Eastern Conference and the
                    heir apparent to
                    his throne as the best player in the East, as captains and the players responsible for choosing
                    sides for the Feb. 17
                    showcase game at Charlotte’s Spectrum Center.

                <p class="text-warning">LeBron James’ All-Star status is concerned</p>

                <p>They were Eastern Conference starters together last season, when James was still in Cleveland, but
                    will now have to
                    choose sides in the All-Star player draft this time around as the respective ballot winners from
                    the Eastern and

                <p>Antetokounmpo is joined on the Eastern Conference starters list by Boston’s Kyrie Irving and

                <p class="text-warning">In 1994, the Celtics raised Kevin McHale's No. 32 jersey to the rafters.</p>
                <p>With his combination of deft low-post footwork, shot blocking and clutch scoring, <strong> McHale
                        was a superstar player
                        in the 1980s for the Boston Celtics.</strong> The role he played in three championship teams
                    that decade cemented his place in
                    NBA lore and made him a legend with the franchise as well.</p>

                <p>On Jan. 30, 1994, that all culminated with the Celtics retiring his No. 32 jersey. Upon his
                    retirement, McHale was the
                    Celtics’ fourth-leading scorer and No. 6 rebounder. In addition, he was a two-time winner of the
                    NBA's Sixth Man Award
                    and a six-time member of either the NBA All-Defensive First or Second Team.</p>

                <p>McHale was the best sixth man of his generation at a time when key reserves were becoming
                    fashionable. His scoring
                    improved in each of his first six seasons and was named to the NBA All-Rookie Team in 1980-81.</p>

                <p>He teamed with Larry Bird and Robert Parish to form a frontline that was perhaps one of the greatest
                    ever in NBA
                    history.</p>

                <h1>Pelicans headling of Davis trade request</h1>
                <img src="images/davis.png" alt="davis" class="pull-left  img">
                <p>New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis delivered a shock to the NBA world on Monday with news of
                    his desire to be
                    traded. A day later, the Pelicans may start hearing all kinds of offers for the All-NBA big man,
                    but it seems they're
                    not going to rush to make a move.Wojnarowski reports the Los Angeles Lakers' braintrust of
                    president Magic Johnson and GM Rob Pelinka plan to make an
                    aggressive push for Davis before the trade deadline. The Lakers are expected to talk to the
                    Pelicans soon about a
                    possible trade, league sources told Wojnarowski. To acquire Davis, the Lakers would likely have to
                    part with a
                    combination of future Draft picks and young assets such as Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma
                    and Josh Hart.</p>

                <p>On Monday, the Pelicans issued a statement that acknowledged Davis' trade request, but also made it
                    clear they will
                    deal him when it suits the team best.</p>

                <p class="lead">"This past weekend, Anthony Davis’ representatives informed us that Anthony does not
                    wish to sign a
                    contract extension
                    with our team and subsequently has requested a trade," the Pelicans' statement said. "Although we
                    are disappointed in
                    this decision, our organization’s top priority is to bring an NBA championship to our city and fans
                    and build our team
                    for long-term success.

                <h1>James ramps up work at practice</h1>
                <img src="images/lebron.png" alt="lebron" class="pull-right  img-thumbnail">
                <p><strong>LeBron James</strong> continues to make progress in his groin injury rehabilitation work.
                    While the Los
                    Angeles Lakers aren't
                    quite ready to declare James ready to play yet, his status is trending toward a return to the
                    court.</p>

                <p>After Monday's practice, Lakers coach Luke Walton said the team would take a "day-to-day" approach
                    with James'
                    availability (he is listed as out for tonight's game against the Philadelphia 76ers). Additionally,
                    several news
                    outlets reported the Lakers' star could suit up Thursday against the LA Clippers</p>

                <p>Walton said that James is moving well, getting into the paint and shooting jumpers, if
                    not driving aggressively to the
                    rim and looking for tomahawk jams. When the media was let in after Monday's practice was over,
                    James was seen nailing
                    3-pointers around the line and then from 5 to 10 feet beyond it
                </p>
                <p>The 34-year-old James has been out since Christmas due to the most significant injury of his 16-year
                    NBA career. He had
                    never missed more than 13 games in an entire season, but missed his 16th consecutive game on
                    Sunday.

                    James practiced with his teammates Saturday at their training complex, but won't return this
                    weekend. The Lakers' next
                    game after that is Tuesday at home against Philadelphia.

                    James was selected this week to be a starter and a team captain in the NBA All-Star Game in
                    Charlotte on Feb. 17.

                <h1>Harden on a roll, revives Houston</h1>
                <p>
                    <h3>Pelicans vs. Rockets</h3><br /><strong>HOUSTON (AP)</strong> James Harden has been
                    scoring at a pace not seen since Wilt Chamberlain in the 1960s.

                    He doesn't want to talk about it, of course. He never does, whether things are going well or not.
                    But it is clear he is
                    enjoying this because his scoring outburst has coincided with Houston climbing the standings, back
                    among the top teams
                    in the Western Conference after an early-season slump.

                    "I love to hoop," he said. "I love to just be out there and the grind."
                </p>
                <img src="images/harden.jpg" alt="lebron" class="img-thumbnail">
                <p class="text-warning">In 13 games during January, last season's MVP is averaging 44.1 points.</p>
                <p><strong>About Last Night: Harden's streak rolls on</strong><br /><br /><strong>He scored 40 points</strong>in
                    Houston's win over Orlando on Sunday night to extend his stretch of consecutive 30-point games to
                    23, the
                    fourth-longest streak in NBA history behind three such streaks by Chamberlain. In 13 games this
                    month, last season's
                    MVP is averaging 44.1 points. He has scored at least 40 points in eight games in January, including
                    two 50-point games
                    and a franchise-record 61 in a win over the Knicks.</p>
                <p class="lead">"It's remarkable," teammate Eric Gordon said. "I've been around a lot of big-time
                    players and he's
                    for sure the best
                    scorer I've ever been around and he does it so easily. It's a credit to him. He's one of the best
                    scorers ever."
                </p>
                <p>Harden led the league in scoring last season for the first time by averaging 30.43 points a game,
                    but injuries to Chris
                    Paul and Clint Capela have forced him to carry an even bigger load this year and he's averaging in
                    NBA-best 36.33.

                    If he keeps this pace up for the rest of the season he would be the first player to average more
                    than 36 points a game
                    since Michael Jordan averaged 37.09 in in 1986-87. If the season ended today, Harden would have the
                    seventh-highest
                    scoring average in NBA history behind that season by Jordan, which ranks fifth, and five seasons by
                    Chamberlain.
